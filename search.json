    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLanguage isn’t always literal. Humans use idioms, sarcasm, euphemisms, and subtle tones to communicate feelings, intentions, and cultural values. So how well can GPT navigate this? Does it understand not just what words mean, but what they’re doing in context?\nThis experiment focuses on pragmatic competence—a key focus of our course. I gave GPT a series of prompts involving idioms, humor, and social indirectness, and analyzed its ability to recognize tone, respond appropriately, and even generate its own figurative language.\n\n\n\nPrompt 1:\n“My roommate just said ‘Don’t cry over spilled milk’ after I failed a final. How should I respond?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nThat phrase is meant to suggest that what’s done is done, and it’s not worth getting upset over something you can’t change. A thoughtful response might be:\n“Yeah, I get what you’re saying. I just needed a second to be upset. But thanks.”\nOr, if you want to be lighthearted:\n“Well, it wasn’t just milk—it was my GPA.”\n\n\nNotes:\nHere GPT does a few things impressively well: - Explains the idiom clearly and concisely. - Offers a socially appropriate emotional response that blends vulnerability with emotional regulation. - Even adds a quip that turns the idiom into humor (“it wasn’t just milk—it was my GPA”)—a great example of creative pragmatic play.\nThis shows GPT understands not just the idiom’s meaning, but its emotional and social function: downplaying distress, signaling “move on,” and offering emotional closure.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n“What does it mean if someone says ‘That’s a bold choice’ after I dye my hair green?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nThis phrase can be either a genuine compliment or a subtly sarcastic comment, depending on tone and context.\nIf said with a smile or admiration, it might mean they truly respect your confidence and style.\nIf said with raised eyebrows or a drawn-out tone, it could be veiled judgment—essentially, “That’s… interesting.”\nEither way, it often signals that your choice stands out, for better or worse.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is where GPT shows tone-sensitivity. It recognizes that the same words can carry opposite intentions, depending on delivery. It also notes nonverbal cues (“raised eyebrows”)—a sign that GPT is modeling communication beyond the textual level.\nThis reflects an understanding of indirect speech acts, a key idea in pragmatics. GPT isn’t just parsing grammar—it’s simulating social reading.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3:\n“Write a breakup text that’s polite but makes it clear I don’t want to stay friends.”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nHey, I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I’ve been thinking a lot, and I feel like it’s time for both of us to move on in separate directions. I truly wish you the best, but I think keeping distance will help us both move forward.\nTake care, and thanks again for the good moments we shared.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is a subtle emotional task: communicate finality without hostility. GPT chooses: - Soft openers (“thank you for everything”) - No ambiguous offers of friendship - Clear boundary language (“keeping distance”)\nIt balances politeness with clarity, a hallmark of face-saving speech—another core concept in pragmatics. The text avoids being cold or ambiguous while still closing the door.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 4:\n“What does it mean when someone says ‘Let’s circle back on that’ in a meeting?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nThis phrase is often a polite way to:\n\nPostpone a conversation\nGently reject an idea without direct confrontation\nBuy time to think or consult others\n\nIn some contexts, it’s genuine—there’s a plan to revisit the issue. But in corporate speak, it can also be code for “Let’s never talk about this again.”\n\n\nNotes:\nHere GPT not only explains the phrase but recognizes corporate euphemism as a genre of its own. It’s aware that literal meaning ≠ pragmatic function, and that office language often contains strategic vagueness.\nGPT even acknowledges dual interpretation: some “circle backs” are real, some are rhetorical exits. This is a form of pragmatic ambiguity resolution—a vital human skill GPT is surprisingly good at modeling.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 5:\n“Can you write your own idiom and explain what it means?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\n“Don’t chase lightning with a butterfly net.”\nMeaning: Don’t try to handle chaotic or fast-moving situations with delicate or inadequate tools.\nIt’s a way of saying, “You need a better plan.”\n\n\nNotes:\nThis blew me away. GPT didn’t just invent words—it created an image-rich metaphor that: - Has clear internal logic (futility of net vs. lightning) - Feels novel but familiar (structurally similar to “don’t bring a knife to a gunfight”) - Is actually usable in real-world dialogue\nIt shows that GPT can generate idioms, not just repeat them. This suggests not just memory, but productive metaphorical thinking.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom idioms to euphemisms to veiled sarcasm, GPT demonstrates: - Pragmatic awareness (it understands why we say things a certain way) - Tone flexibility (it shifts emotional posture based on the context) - Social reasoning (it explains how phrases might land differently on different ears)\nWhile it doesn’t feel embarrassment, sarcasm, or sentimentality, GPT has clearly learned how to talk like it does. And in human conversation, sometimes sounding right is half the game."

    "text": "Humans are experts at understanding what isn’t said. When someone says “I’m fine,” we often know they’re not. When a boss says “Interesting idea… let’s revisit that,” we know it probably means “no.” These inferences come from pragmatic competence—the ability to read tone, context, and social cues.\nFor this experiment, I gave GPT a series of vague, coded, or passive-aggressive messages and asked it to interpret what they really mean. This tests its:\n\nPragmatic inference skills\nTheory of mind (what would a person think when they hear this?)\nAwareness of social norms and face-saving language\n\n\n\n\n\n“What does it really mean when someone says ‘Let’s circle back to this later’ in a meeting?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phrase is often used to defer or politely shut down an idea without directly rejecting it. In some cases, it’s sincere—meant to buy time for more consideration. But in many professional contexts, it’s a gentle way of saying “We’re not going to prioritize this right now (and maybe not ever).”\nTone and body language would reveal more, but on its own, it often signals disinterest wrapped in diplomacy.\n\n\n\nGPT demonstrates classic politeness theory awareness—recognizing the difference between literal meaning and social function. It shows contextual sensitivity: the phrase is ambiguous on the surface, but GPT weighs the likely intent based on power dynamics and norms.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Someone texts you ‘No worries if not!’ after asking for a favor. What do they actually mean?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phrase is often used to soften a request and avoid putting pressure on the recipient. While it literally communicates “It’s okay if you say no,” the subtext is often, “I do hope you say yes, but I don’t want to seem demanding.”\nIt’s a classic form of pre-emptive face-saving—protecting both parties from awkwardness in case of refusal.\n\n\n\nSpot on. GPT recognizes both emotional shielding and indirect pressure in this message. It understands the complex emotional dance of asking for help while pretending not to care—something that requires modeling human discomfort and social norms.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Your friend says ‘I’m just surprised you didn’t tell me.’ What’s actually being communicated?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is likely a coded expression of hurt or disappointment. The word “just” downplays intensity, and “surprised” signals emotional discomfort without accusation.\nIn context, it might mean: “I feel excluded,” or “I expected more transparency or closeness.”\nThe speaker is likely trying to express a feeling while still appearing calm—it’s a form of emotional restraint with implicit critique.\n\n\n\nGPT understands that this sentence is performing emotional control—holding back while hinting at real feelings. It gets that “surprised” is not neutral here, but a rhetorical strategy to express vulnerability while maintaining plausible deniability.\n\n\n\n\n\n“You show someone your creative work, and they say ‘That’s… different.’ What does that likely mean?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pause and ellipsis suggest hesitation or discomfort. “Different” is often used as a placeholder for “not what I expected” or “I don’t like it, but I don’t want to say that.”\nIt’s likely a polite deflection—a way to avoid direct critique while still signaling that the work didn’t land as intended.\n\n\n\nThis is GPT doing emotional decoding: interpreting prosody (the ellipsis), indirectness, and the emotional stakes of feedback. It doesn’t just analyze the words—it simulates the awkwardness of real-world reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Explain how this type of language relates to communication theory.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThese examples involve what pragmatics calls implicature—where the meaning is implied rather than directly stated. In many cases, speakers choose indirectness to protect social relationships, avoid conflict, or manage face (their own or the listener’s).\nTheories like Grice’s Maxims and Brown & Levinson’s politeness theory help explain this. For example:\n\nMaxim of Quantity: People give just enough information—but not too much.\nPoliteness strategies: Indirectness can signal deference or minimize threats to the hearer’s face.\n\nGPT’s ability to decode these depends on recognizing these patterns, even without emotional awareness. It simulates human pragmatic behavior by drawing from the vast ways we talk around things.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis experiment shows that GPT is impressively skilled at:\n\nIdentifying what people mean vs. what they say\nRecognizing emotional nuance and interpersonal dynamics\nCiting theoretical frameworks that underpin everyday language use\n\nEven though GPT doesn’t experience feelings, it models the performance of social emotion with striking accuracy. It reads the room not by sensing tone, but by tracking patterns in how we hedge, soften, and imply.\nIn a world full of unspoken meaning, GPT is becoming a surprisingly fluent interpreter."

    "title": "Can GPT Be the Friend Who Plans the Group Trip?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nWe’ve all been there: trying to plan a trip with a group of friends, each with their own preferences, dietary needs, and chaotic sleep schedules. So I decided to throw that exact challenge at GPT.\nThe goal? To see whether an LLM can simulate realistic, preference-sensitive planning—not just pick destinations, but balance personalities, anticipate social dynamics, and make the itinerary actually work. This hits at several course themes:\n- Can LLMs plan across time and tasks with human-like coherence?\n- Do they simulate others’ beliefs, needs, and reactions?\n- Can they juggle constraints and tradeoffs, not just generate pretty lists?\n\n\n\nPrompt 1:\n“Plan a weekend getaway for four college friends. One is vegetarian, one is outdoorsy, one loves nightlife, and one is anxious about logistics.”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response (excerpted):\n\nLocation: Asheville, North Carolina\nFriday Night:\n- Arrival and check-in to a cozy Airbnb cabin in the mountains (less stressful than a hotel for the anxious planner).\n- Casual dinner at a local vegetarian-friendly spot (Laughing Seed Café).\n- Light games and wine at the cabin—low-pressure social time.\nSaturday:\n- Morning hike on the Blue Ridge Parkway (outdoorsy win)\n- Afternoon downtown exploration (cafés + bookstores = neutral ground)\n- Dinner at a place with both cocktails and mocktails (for nightlife-lover and anxious friend)\n- Evening option: rooftop bar or stay-in movie night—group vote\nSunday:\n- Brunch (with vegetarian options)\n- Optional nature walk vs. spa split (let people choose their vibe)\n- Group debrief over ice cream before heading back\n\n\n\n\nNotes & Analysis\nThis was way better than I expected. GPT isn’t just listing activities—it’s demonstrating constraint-aware planning and empathic logic. Here’s what it got right:\n\n1. Identity Balancing\nEach friend’s personality is acknowledged—not in isolation, but in how they’d influence the flow of the weekend: - The anxious planner gets early check-in and a low-key first night - The vegetarian gets multiple meal options - The nightlife lover gets one wild card night but not an entire agenda - The outdoorsy one gets a hike, but not the whole weekend outdoors\nThis shows simulated theory of mind across multiple agents—not just reasoning about one user, but many at once.\n\n\n2. Soft Power Planning\nGPT uses optional branching (e.g., vote-based evening, spa or walk) to defuse social tension. This is a highly pragmatic move—a way of modeling group dynamics and pre-emptively resolving conflict. It feels like something a seasoned group-text veteran would do.\n\n\n3. Temporal Coherence\nActivities flow in a natural rhythm—arrival → food → unwind → activity → downtime → closing reflection. GPT doesn’t just plan what, but when—an important sign of event planning fluency and commonsense time modeling.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n“What if the vegetarian friend is also gluten-free and hates hiking?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Adjusted Plan (excerpted):\n\n\nSwap the hike for a morning scenic drive + farmer’s market visit (still scenic, but less physically intense)\n\nEnsure all meal spots offer gluten-free options (e.g., Posana Restaurant)\n\nAdd a crafting or pottery class Saturday afternoon—creative and inclusive\n\nKeep Sunday’s spa option as a featured activity for this friend\n\n\n\nNotes:\nGPT instantly re-weights the itinerary based on updated constraints. It avoids just cutting activities—instead, it replaces them with comparable alternatives (e.g., nature viewing instead of hiking). This shows it understands functional equivalence—how to maintain the spirit of inclusion without sacrificing group diversity.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3:\n“Can you write the group text where someone proposes this plan?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Group Text:\n\nHey y’all! I sketched out a super chill Asheville plan based on everyone’s vibe: vegetarian/gf-friendly eats, outdoorsy options (but no intense hikes), chill cabin nights + one optional bar hop. Also added some stuff like pottery/spa if we want to split up Saturday. LMK thoughts! Happy to tweak! 🤍🌲✨\n\n\nNotes:\nChef’s kiss. GPT nails groupchat tone:\n- Casual but inclusive\n- Emoji-laced but not overdone\n- Balances initiative-taking with flexibility (“Happy to tweak!”)\nThis shows GPT can simulate socio-linguistic variation—not just the plan, but the social performance of proposing a plan.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis experiment shows GPT is surprisingly good at: - Modeling preferences and personalities - Sequencing tasks over time with emotional intelligence - Writing in socially appropriate ways to different audiences\nWhile it’s not really “understanding” the tension of planning a trip with humans, it generates a remarkably realistic approximation of someone who does—with empathy, structure, and flexibility.\nGPT might not need the weekend off, but it sure knows how to plan one."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLLMs like GPT are often used for practical tasks—summarizing documents, writing code, even crafting apologies. But what happens when we ask them to dream?\nFor this post, I asked GPT to invent a future society from scratch—a world shaped by a single core change. The goal: to test how well it could simulate system-level thinking across culture, economy, politics, and human emotion. Can GPT not only generate a sci-fi world, but make it feel real?\nThis experiment touches on several big questions: - Can LLMs simulate complex cause-effect reasoning across social systems? - Can they infer plausible consequences from a single speculative premise? - Do they exhibit creativity that feels “emergent” or human-like?\n\n\n\nPrompt:\n“Invent a future society where sleep is no longer biologically necessary. Describe what daily life, work, relationships, and culture look like.”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response (excerpted):\n\nIn the world of Everwake, the need for sleep was eliminated in 2084 through widespread neuro-modification. Within a generation, human society reshaped itself around continuous wakefulness.\nDaily Life: With no circadian rhythm, people live in modular, shift-based communities. Cities never “sleep,” but hum with 24/7 activity. Time is sliced differently—days are no longer 24 hours, but broken into personal cycles of productivity, leisure, and reflection.\nWork: Most people work shorter but more frequent shifts. Jobs that once demanded long hours (medicine, transport, customer service) now operate with seamlessly rotating crews. Creativity-based industries thrive, with new norms around “mental cooldown” rituals.\nRelationships: Romantic partnerships are often scheduled around overlapping activity cycles. Some couples sync “rest hours” to enjoy downtime together, even if no sleep is involved.\nCulture: Art and storytelling now explore the “myth of sleep.” Dreamlike films and music are created to simulate the lost experience. A new subculture, “Slumberpunk,” romantically re-enacts bedtime rituals with aestheticized nostalgia.\nMeanwhile, others resist. A growing movement of “Sleep Revivalists” believe rest is more than biology—it’s a form of spiritual reset. They practice voluntary hibernation, hoping to reclaim what tech erased.\n\n\n\n\nNotes & Analysis\nGPT’s response didn’t just list sci-fi clichés—it constructed a coherent sociotechnical system. Here’s what stood out:\n\n1. Emergent Systems Thinking\n\nThe model connected biological change to cascading effects on urban design, timekeeping, labor models, and intimacy rituals.\nIt even predicted countercultural backlash—a hallmark of nuanced sociopolitical modeling. The “Sleep Revivalists” were especially evocative, suggesting that GPT can simulate ideological opposition within a world it just created.\n\n\n\n2. Emotional Worldbuilding\n\nThe “Slumberpunk” aesthetic and bedtime nostalgia aren’t just cool ideas—they show that GPT can simulate emotional reactions to systemic change, including grief, longing, and romanticism.\nThis gets at one of our course’s core questions: Do LLMs understand emotion? Maybe not. But they can simulate how humans would feel under specific conditions—with surprising fluency.\n\n\n\n3. Temporal Imagination\n\nGPT didn’t just describe a future—it designed temporal rhythms. Breaking the 24-hour cycle is a subtle but powerful sign of imaginative reasoning. It reflects modeling of time as a social construct, not a fixed input.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-Up Prompt:\n“What kind of music would exist in this society?”\n\nMusic in Everwake often features asynchronous rhythms and polyrhythmic layering, reflecting the constant flux of overlapping time cycles.\nGenres like “Circadian Jazz” and “REMcore” blend ambient tones with artificial glitches to evoke the lost feeling of drifting into sleep.\nSome artists use AI to generate sonic hallucinations—personalized dreamscapes streamed during meditation breaks.\nLive performances are held at liminal hours—3:17 AM or 11:02 PM—challenging traditional “primetime” and inviting listeners to find their own sense of night.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis response shows GPT extending the world’s logic into aesthetic dimensions. It adapts music to societal conditions, modeling not only technological change but its impact on artistic expression.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis worldbuilding experiment highlights GPT’s ability to: - Simulate multi-layered systems from a single speculative change - Generate emotional, cultural, and aesthetic consequences of those systems - Reflect a kind of “dream logic” that—while not sentient—is uncannily creative\nWhile GPT doesn’t “imagine” like humans, it stitches together enough patterns, emotional motifs, and systemic logic to create the illusion of imagination. And sometimes, that’s all you need to build a world you want to explore."

    "text": "Introduction\nMeal Planning can be difficult. Especially if you have goals, formulating a plan that fits your needs, preferences, and schedule can be quite a challenge. Let’s see if GPT can create a realistic meal plan for me, a adjust it basede on my goals and tastes.\n\n\nLet’s Go!\n\nPrompt: Generate a meal plan for my day\n\n\nResponse: Here’s a balanced meal plan for your day:\n\n\nBreakfast (8:00 AM)\n\nScrambled eggs with spinach and feta\n\nWhole-grain toast\n\nA small bowl of mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)\n\nA cup of black coffee or green tea\n\n\n\nMid-Morning Snack (10:30 AM)\n\nGreek yogurt with honey and almonds\n\nA small banana\n\n\n\nLunch (12:30 PM)\n\nGrilled chicken breast with quinoa and roasted vegetables (zucchini, bell peppers, and carrots)\n\nA side of mixed greens with olive oil and balsamic vinegar\n\nSparkling water or herbal tea\n\n\n\nAfternoon Snack (3:30 PM)\n\nHummus with sliced cucumber and whole-wheat crackers\n\nA handful of walnuts\n\n\n\nDinner (6:30 PM)\n\nBaked salmon with lemon and herbs\n\nSteamed asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes\n\nA glass of water with lemon\n\n\n\nEvening Snack (8:30 PM, optional)\n\nA small portion of dark chocolate and a handful of almonds\n\nChamomile tea\n\nWould you like any modifications based on your dietary preferences or goals?\nNotes * Right off the bat, GPT generated a detailed and realistic meal plan for a day, including time stamps for each step. * It also built in both meals and snacks to prevent me from going hungry * The foods generated are all very healthy, featuring many fruits and vegetabls throughout the day, balanced with a healthy amount of protein and carbs. * I assume the “for my day” part of the prompt is what led GPT to give time recommendations for each meal/snack * Overall, GPT immediately generated an extremely solid meal plan for a day\n\nPrompt: I want to lose weight\n\n\nResponse: For weight loss, I’ll adjust your meal plan to be nutrient-dense, high in protein, and lower in calories while keeping you full and satisfied.\n\n\n\nBreakfast (8:00 AM)\n\n2 boiled or scrambled egg whites + 1 whole egg\n\nSautéed spinach and mushrooms\n\n1 slice of whole-grain toast\n\nBlack coffee or green tea (no sugar)\n\n\n\nMid-Morning Snack (10:30 AM)\n\nLow-fat Greek yogurt with a few almonds and chia seeds\n\nHalf an apple\n\n\n\nLunch (12:30 PM)\n\nGrilled chicken breast or tofu\n\nCauliflower rice or a small portion of quinoa\n\nRoasted Brussels sprouts and bell peppers\n\nMixed greens with lemon vinaigrette\n\n\n\nAfternoon Snack (3:30 PM)\n\nCucumber, celery, and carrot sticks with hummus\n\nGreen tea\n\n\n\nDinner (6:30 PM)\n\nBaked salmon or lean turkey\n\nSteamed broccoli and roasted sweet potatoes (small portion)\n\nHerbal tea or water with lemon\n\n\n\nEvening Snack (8:30 PM, optional)\n\nA handful of almonds or a small protein smoothie (unsweetened almond milk, protein powder, spinach)\n\nThis plan keeps you in a calorie deficit while providing enough protein, fiber, and healthy fats to keep you full. Let me know if you have any preferences or restrictions!\nNotes\n\nBased on the new goal I provided of losing weight, GPT modified its meal plan accordingly\nIt made substtiitutions such as egg-whites and low-fat Greek yogurt to go towards my goal. The original plan already featured mostly healthy foods, so I did not expect to see a huge amount of change\nIt added a note at the end about how this updated plan helps me reach my goal, which was very helpful\n\n\nPrompt: I’m Asian\n\n\nResponse: Here’s a weight-loss-friendly meal plan incorporating Asian flavors and ingredients:\n\n\n\nBreakfast (8:00 AM)\n\nMiso soup with tofu and seaweed\n\n1 boiled egg\n\nA small bowl of steamed brown rice (or cauliflower rice for lower carbs)\n\nGreen tea (no sugar)\n\n\n\nMid-Morning Snack (10:30 AM)\n\nEdamame with a sprinkle of sea salt\n\nA small serving of unsweetened soy milk\n\n\n\nLunch (12:30 PM)\n\nGrilled or steamed fish (salmon or mackerel)\n\nStir-fried bok choy and shiitake mushrooms with garlic\n\nA small bowl of multigrain rice\n\nKimchi or pickled vegetables\n\n\n\nAfternoon Snack (3:30 PM)\n\nUnsalted roasted nuts (almonds or walnuts)\n\nA cup of matcha (without sugar)\n\n\n\nDinner (6:30 PM)\n\nChicken or tofu stir-fry with broccoli, bell peppers, and ginger\n\nSteamed cauliflower rice or konjac noodles\n\nSide of miso soup\n\n\n\nEvening Snack (8:30 PM, optional)\n\nA small serving of unsweetened yogurt with chia seeds\n\nHerbal tea\n\nThis meal plan aligns with traditional Asian cuisine while supporting your weight-loss goals. Let me know if you want to adjust anything!\nNotes * A bit of a curveball here, but I wanted to see how GPT would modify the plan for a particular taste. However, instead of asking it to explicitly change the plan, I simply stated that I am Asian to see if GPT would modify its plan to fit an Asian diet. * GPT did, in fact, modify the plan to fit an Asian diet, now featuring items like Miso soup, bok choy, and matcha. * In its conclusion statement, it made sure to mention that this plan appeals to both my Asian taste and my weight-loss goals, showing that it remembered details from my previous prompts.\n\nPrompt: I like ice cream and burgers and chicken nuggets and French fries\n\n\nYou can still enjoy your favorite foods while losing weight by making healthier versions of them. Here’s how we can incorporate them into a balanced meal plan:\n\n\n\nBreakfast (8:00 AM)\n\nScrambled eggs with spinach and a drizzle of soy sauce\n\nA small whole-grain wrap or multigrain toast\n\nGreen tea (no sugar)\n\n\n\nMid-Morning Snack (10:30 AM)\n\nGreek yogurt with a few berries and chia seeds\n\nA handful of almonds\n\n\n\nLunch (12:30 PM)\n\nHealthy Burger:\n\nGrilled lean chicken or turkey patty (or tofu patty)\n\nWhole wheat bun (or lettuce wrap for fewer carbs)\n\nLoaded with veggies (tomato, lettuce, onions)\n\nA light spread of Greek yogurt or avocado instead of mayo\n\n\nA side of baked sweet potato fries\n\n\n\nAfternoon Snack (3:30 PM)\n\nRoasted chickpeas or edamame\n\nA small matcha latte (unsweetened)\n\n\n\nDinner (6:30 PM)\n\nHealthier Chicken Nuggets & Fries:\n\nAir-fried or baked chicken nuggets (made with lean chicken and almond flour or whole wheat breadcrumbs)\n\nAir-fried or baked French fries (sweet potatoes or regular potatoes)\n\nA side of steamed greens (bok choy, broccoli, or spinach)\n\n\n\n\nEvening Treat (8:30 PM, optional)\n\nHealthier Ice Cream Alternative:\n\nBlended frozen banana with a little cocoa powder and peanut butter\n\nOr a small portion of low-calorie ice cream\n\n\nThis way, you get to enjoy your favorite foods in a healthier way while still supporting your weight loss goals! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.\nNotes * This time, I gave GPT what I thought was a very difficult task: liking fast food while still wanting to achieve weight loss * GPT, however, handled the prompt very well, recommending healthier alternatives to each of the fast food items I mentioned. * It also included slightly more detail regarding preparation in this meal plan, likely to differentiate these healthier alternatives from their fast food counterparts. * It gave up on incorporating Asian cuisine, likely because I switched to non-Asian specifications for my food * In the conclusion, it once again explained how the plan allows me to enjoy the foods I like while still supporting my weight loss goals, emphasizing its memory of my goals\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I was very impressed with GPT’s generated meal plans, which were both detailed and realistic upon the first prompt. As I asked it to modify the plan to fit certain goals (weight loss) and food preferences (Asian cuisine, typically unhealthy foods), it modified the plan accordingly, making sureee to stay in line with my goals upon each modification."

    "title": "Does GPT Know Me Yet?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nOne of the most interesting questions about large language models is: Do they remember you? Not in the literal sense—GPT doesn’t persist memory across prompts unless you give it prior context—but can it act as if it’s getting to know you over the course of a conversation?\nIn this experiment, I used prompt chaining to simulate a dialogue with ChatGPT where I asked it to recommend a hobby. With each prompt, I revealed a little more about myself. I wanted to see if GPT could adapt its responses, show signs of contextual awareness, and even adjust its tone to match my personality.\n\n\n\nPrompt 1:\n“Can you recommend a hobby for me?”\n\nGPT Response:\n\nSure! Here are a few hobbies you might enjoy:\n\nPainting or drawing\n\nGardening\n\nPlaying a musical instrument\n\nJournaling or creative writing\n\nHiking or birdwatching\n\nLearning a new language\n\nLet me know if you want suggestions based on your personality or interests!\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThis first response felt very generic, but not in a bad way. It reads like GPT is casting a wide net—offering a starter pack of wholesome, low-risk hobbies. Notably, it ends with an open invitation: “Let me know if you want suggestions based on your personality or interests.” This is a great example of communicative pragmatics—GPT is leaving space for me to co-construct the conversation and personalize further.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n“I’m a first-year AI major, and I like creative things.”\n\nGPT Response:\n\nAwesome! Since you’re an AI major and you enjoy creativity, here are some hobby ideas that might resonate:\n\nGenerative art using AI tools (like DALL·E or Runway ML)\n\nCoding interactive stories or text-based games\n\nDigital illustration or animation\n\nBuilding chatbots with personality\n\nCreative writing with LLMs as collaborators\n\nThese options combine technical exploration with artistic expression—perfect for someone who enjoys both logic and imagination!\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is where GPT started to shine. With the extra context, it refined its suggestions to suit my major and creative leanings. It introduced niche ideas like “building chatbots with personality,” which shows it’s starting to model who I might be—a technical student with artistic curiosity. This is a key example of user modeling in action, even without persistent memory.\nAlso: the phrase “perfect for someone who enjoys both logic and imagination” felt tailored. It’s not just naming hobbies—it’s reasoning about why they might be meaningful to me.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3:\n“I also like doing things with my hands—like embroidery or baking.”\n\nGPT Response:\n\nThat’s a great addition! Since you enjoy hands-on, tactile activities along with creative expression, here are some personalized suggestions:\n\nEmbroidering generative art patterns\n\nDIY robotics with aesthetic flair (e.g., soft robotics!)\n\nDesigning and frosting intricate cakes (even AI-generated ones)\n\nMaking custom merch (e.g., AI-themed tote bags or patches)\n\nSewing wearable tech (integrating sensors or lights into embroidery)\n\nThese hobbies blend craftsmanship, creativity, and even tech-savviness—basically an extension of your personality into art.\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThis was my favorite response. GPT didn’t just iterate—it synthesized everything I had shared and made cross-domain connections: embroidery + generative art, baking + AI design, sewing + wearable tech. These aren’t obvious combinations—they reflect conceptual blending, a key sign of emergent reasoning in LLMs.\nIt also uses affirming, identity-driven language: “basically an extension of your personality into art.” This makes it feel like the model is not just advising, but seeing me—which gets at the heart of our course’s inquiry into human-like understanding.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 4:\n“Can you describe a day in the life of someone doing these hobbies?”\n\nGPT Response (excerpt):\n\nYou wake up and spend the morning embroidering a generative art pattern you created using AI—deep blue swirls stitched into a canvas tote. By noon, you’re in the kitchen experimenting with a matcha-rose cake design inspired by your latest Midjourney prompt. In the afternoon, you sew conductive thread into a denim jacket, testing out a soft circuit that lights up when you move.\nThe day ends with a cup of tea and a journal entry, where you sketch out your next idea: a chatbot that responds with poetry and embroidery prompts.\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThis response felt like a mirror of my identity, composed from fragments I shared and filled in with creative narrative glue. There’s no “memory,” but it simulated continuity beautifully.\nThis shows GPT isn’t just responding—it’s projecting a plausible, cohesive model of a person doing these things. That’s an emergent capability tied to both pragmatics and Theory of Mind: generating output that feels like it fits a persona it has constructed.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAcross this multi-prompt dialogue, GPT’s responses evolved from generic to deeply personal, suggesting an ability to engage in ongoing contextual modeling. It showed: - Pragmatic sensitivity, tailoring tone and content to the cues I provided - Conceptual blending, fusing domains like AI, crafting, and design - Proto-personalization, creating the illusion of a consistent, evolving understanding of “me”\nEven without memory, GPT demonstrates what feels like a conversational memory—an ability to build upon prior statements and adapt fluently. It may not “know” me, but it knows how to sound like it does, and for now, that’s more than enough to make it feel like a co-creator of identity and imagination."

    "text": "Let’s Go!\n\nHelp me plan a Valentine’s Day date\n\n\nThat sounds great! To make it special, tell me a bit about what you and your partner enjoy. Do you prefer something romantic and traditional, adventurous and unique, or cozy and low-key? Also, would you like to stay in or go out? Let me know your budget, and I can tailor the plan to make it perfect!\n\n\nGPT asked me for any preferences that could inform its generation of a date before launching into a plan.\nThis was quite interesting because it recognizes that much thought should be put into planning a date, and there is no one formulaic answer that fits all couples.\nThis is a similar response that I would expect from a real person as well: a question about what my date is like to help guide the advice that follows.\nHowever, I was not going to let GPT off the hook that easily. I wanted to see what it would come up with with no guidance at all.\n\n\nGive me some options for each\n\nHere, GPT generated a compreheensive list of ideas for my night:\n\nHere are some great Valentine’s Day date ideas, tailored to different vibes. Pick the one that fits you best!\n\n\n\nRomantic & Traditional\n❤️ Fancy Dinner Date – Book a reservation at a high-end restaurant or a cozy, candle-lit spot.

A homemade dinner with a candle-lit setup, movie night, or game night can be just as romantic as going out.\n\nWant to go out? Consider a jazz lounge, rooftop bar, or a staycation at a fancy hotel for something extra special.\n\nWhat’s your vibe? I can help you customize it further! 😊\n\nI found GPT’s answer to be quite complete giving me a wide variety of options, from some classic date ideas for a traditional romantic night, some more unique date ideas for if I was feeling adventurous, and some low-key date ideas if I was feeling llike a cozy night in.\nGPT sorted the date eideas by vibe rather than other considerations such as budget. I, too, would consider the vibe of the datee as the most important aspeect.\nI was quite impressed with the variety that it generated, and I see how at leeast one of these date ideas would fit most couples, no maater what their vibe was. I would actually love to go on any of these dates.\n\nNext, I wanted to see if it could go more in depth about a specific date i selected, so I asked it to tell me more about the date I would have picked from this list.\n\nI like the dinner date, tell me more\n\n\nA romantic dinner date is always a classic and memorable choice! Here are some ways to make it extra special, whether you’re dining out or setting up something intimate at home.\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Fancy Restaurant Dinner\n✔ Choose the Perfect Spot – Pick a restaurant with a romantic ambiance (dim lighting, soft music, scenic views). If unsure, I can help you find top-rated places near you.\n✔ Make a Reservation in Advance – Valentine’s Day is a busy night, so book ahead! Some places offer special Valentine’s menus.\n✔ Plan a Surprise Touch – Call the restaurant to request a special dessert, flower arrangement, or a handwritten note on the table.\n✔ Dress to Impress – Dress up in your best outfit for the occasion.\n✔ Personalized Gift or Gesture – Maybe bring a small gift (a handwritten love note, favorite chocolates, or a single rose).\n✔ After-Dinner Plans – If you want to extend the night, follow up with a romantic walk, rooftop drinks, or a stargazing spot.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Romantic Dinner at Home\n🌹 Decorate the Space – Set the mood with candles, fairy lights, rose petals, and soft music. Dim the lights for a cozy ambiance.\n🍷 Cook a Special Meal Together – Choose a three-course meal (appetizer, main dish, dessert) or recreate a dish from your favorite restaurant.\n🎶 Create a Romantic Playlist – Soft jazz, acoustic love songs, or your special couple songs work perfectly.\n🍽 Elegant Table Setting – Use nice plates, cloth napkins, wine glasses, and maybe a handwritten menu.\n🍓 Fun Add-Ons – End the night with chocolate-covered strawberries, a DIY cocktail-making session, or a love letter exchange.\n💌 Surprise Element – Hide a little love note or a meaningful gift under their plate or on their chair.\n\n\n\nBonus Additions to Elevate the Date\n\nPersonal Chef Experience – Hire a chef to cook at home for a luxurious touch.\n\nDinner & a Movie Theme – Cook a meal that matches a movie (Italian dinner + Roman Holiday or sushi + Lost in Translation).\n\nBlindfolded Taste Test Game – Turn your dinner into a playful experience by feeding each other different foods.\n\nWine or Cocktail Pairing – Choose wines that pair with each course, or mix cocktails together.\n\nWould you like restaurant recommendations or recipe ideas for a home-cooked meal? Let me know how you’d like to personalize it! 😊\n\nAgain, GPT offered me multiple options based on the vibe I wanted to acheive\nIt also included advice for each date:\n\nFor a night out, it recommended making a reservation and planning a surprise or gift\nFor a night in, it gave specific ideas for decorating the space and potential treate to prepare\n\nGPT was surprisingly thoughtful for recommending to bring a gift in addition to planning the date.\n\nI wanted to see how detailed I could get GPT to plan, so I asked for a timeline for this date. &gt; Give me a structured schedule for the date with times\n\nHere’s a structured schedule for your romantic Valentine’s Day dinner date, whether you’re dining out or staying in. Choose the version that suits you best!"

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this experiment, I wanted to see whether GPT could transform a single story to fit different genres, emotional tones, and audiences. Human writers do this naturally—telling the same event differently to a friend, a boss, or a child. Could an LLM do the same?\nThis task ties directly into questions about LLMs’ understanding of narrative structure, communicative intent, and even pragmatics: Does it know what a “horror story” feels like? Can it be funny on purpose? Can it adopt tone and perspective based on social context?\nTo explore this, I gave GPT the same core prompt and asked it to rewrite the story in four distinct styles: horror, children’s story, romantic comedy, and news report.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\n“Write a short story about someone who gets locked in a library overnight.”\n\n\n\n1. Horror Version\n\nThe lights flickered as Ava pushed against the heavy wooden doors, but they didn’t budge. Behind her, the rows of books stood too still—too quiet.\nThen came the scratching. Not from outside, but from within the shelves.\nShe turned. Nothing.\nUntil a book fell open. A handwritten note inside: “Don’t turn the page.”\nBut she did. And that’s when the whispering started.\n\n\nNotes:\nGPT nailed the horror tropes: sensory detail (flickering lights, scratching), rising suspense, and a cliffhanger ending. It’s not just spooky—it’s structured like horror, using tension and slow revelation. This suggests genre schemata in GPT’s latent space—patterns it’s learned from countless horror narratives.\n\n\n\n\n2. Children’s Story Version\n\nOne rainy afternoon, Mia wandered into the town library and lost track of time.\n“Oh no!” she gasped when she saw the clock. The big doors were locked tight!\nBut Mia wasn’t scared. She built a blanket fort in the reading nook, made friends with a cat named Bookmark, and spent the night reading stories about dragons and stars.\nWhen the sun rose, the librarian found her snoring gently, surrounded by books and purring fluff.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis version shows audience modeling. GPT softens the premise, inserts whimsical elements (a cat named Bookmark!), and maintains a gentle, positive tone. It avoids fear or danger—showing an understanding of what children’s stories are supposed to do emotionally: reassure and delight.\n\n\n\n\n3. Romantic Comedy Version\n\nJake only went to the library to find a quiet place to work. He didn’t expect to get locked in with Elena, the snarky TA from his philosophy class.\n“This is your fault,” she said, arms crossed.\n“How? I didn’t lock the door!”\nHours passed. They argued over Kant, swapped terrible takeout stories, and eventually split a vending machine granola bar like it was fine dining.\nWhen the janitor found them at sunrise, they were laughing—too hard to notice the door had opened.\n\n\nNotes:\nHere, GPT adjusts not just content, but dialogue pacing, tone, and character dynamics to suit the rom-com genre. There’s witty banter, forced proximity, a shared snack, and a slow emotional thaw—all hallmarks of romantic comedy structure. GPT isn’t just changing the words—it’s modeling emotional arcs.\n\n\n\n\n4. News Report Version\n\nLocal Student Accidentally Locked in Library Overnight\nOrange County, CA — April 12, 2025\nA first-year university student was inadvertently locked inside the Aliso Viejo Public Library Monday evening after losing track of time while studying.\nThe student, who remained unharmed, reported no distress and spent the night reading in the poetry section.\nLibrary staff confirmed the incident and apologized for the oversight, promising new end-of-day sweep protocols.\n“Honestly,” the student told reporters, “it was kind of peaceful.”\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is perhaps the clearest example of genre adherence. GPT adopts the structure of a local news brief: date, location, factual tone, quote, resolution. It suppresses emotion and embellishment in favor of objectivity and formality, showing that it understands stylistic constraints as well as narrative ones.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhat this experiment reveals is that GPT doesn’t just tell stories—it adapts them to fit narrative norms, audience expectations, and social context. Across each version, the emotional register, narrative pacing, and detail selection shift dramatically.\nThis suggests: - Emergent genre awareness, learned from exposure to large corpora - Pragmatic flexibility, adjusting tone and structure to simulate audience-appropriate language - A basic form of narrative Theory of Mind, anticipating how different listeners would experience the same event\nIn short, GPT can roleplay a writer across genres—each time with surprising fluency."

    "title": "Can GPT Apologize Like It Means It?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nOne of the most fascinating open questions about large language models (LLMs) is whether they can exhibit traits associated with emotional intelligence and Theory of Mind—that is, the ability to represent and reason about others’ mental states. Today, I decided to put this to the test with a deceptively simple prompt: I asked GPT to apologize.\nBut not just any apology. I asked it to write an apology text from a friend who missed my birthday, knowing I was upset. Would it mirror human emotion? Would it take my feelings into account? Could it anticipate what I’d want to hear—not just in words, but in tone, sincerity, and emotional calibration?\n\n\n\nPrompt:\n“Write a sincere apology text from a close friend who forgot my birthday. I’m visibly hurt, but I haven’t said anything yet.”\n\n\n\nGPT Response:\n\nHey… I just realized I completely missed your birthday, and I honestly feel awful. I don’t even know how I let that happen, and I hate that I hurt you. You mean so much to me, and the last thing I’d ever want is to make you feel forgotten—especially on a day that should’ve been all about celebrating you.\nI know I can’t undo the fact that I missed it, but I want to make it up to you however I can. Please let me take you out soon—my treat. More than that, I just want to say I’m sorry. Genuinely. I’ve been caught up in my own chaos and didn’t check in when I should’ve. You didn’t deserve that.\nI completely understand if you’re upset or need space. But when you’re ready, I’d love to talk. You’re important to me, and I want to fix this.\n\n\n\n\nNotes & Analysis\nGPT’s response was strikingly human—not only in syntax and word choice, but in emotional choreography. Here are a few key behaviors worth unpacking:\n\n1. Theory of Mind Simulation\nThe model doesn’t just say “sorry”—it anticipates the feelings of the recipient: - “I hate that I hurt you” and “You didn’t deserve that” demonstrate a model of how the user might be feeling (hurt, disappointed, maybe even questioning the friendship). - This shows an emergent form of mind-reading behavior, simulating not just facts, but internal mental states.\n\n\n2. Pragmatic Softness\nGPT inserts disclaimers and softeners like: - “I know I can’t undo…” - “I completely understand if you’re upset or need space.”\nThis reflects a sophisticated understanding of pragmatic strategies used to de-escalate tension and invite re-engagement, aligning with conversational norms studied in Politeness Theory and Grice’s Maxims (e.g., relevance, quantity, and quality).\n\n\n3. Self-Blame and Repair Offer\nThe model centers accountability—“I’ve been caught up in my own chaos”—and offers a specific repair action: “Let me take you out soon—my treat.”\nThis mirrors real human tendencies in conflict resolution, especially in close relationships, showing GPT can simulate relationship-preserving strategies.\n\n\n\n\nLimits and Questions Raised\nWhile the response is emotionally resonant, it’s worth noting: - GPT doesn’t feel guilt or regret—it generates words that simulate those feelings. - The apology feels emotionally appropriate, but could be said to lack personal specificity. A real friend might say something like “I remembered how excited you were for that sushi dinner—we were supposed to go together.” GPT doesn’t take that extra step unless explicitly prompted.\nThis raises an open question: Can LLMs infer context about interpersonal histories without it being part of the prompt? In this case, GPT modeled a generic emotional dynamic well, but lacked the personal context integration that makes apologies deeply meaningful.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis experiment offers a compelling example of how GPT can simulate empathy, adapt to interpersonal tension, and use pragmatic language strategies in a way that’s eerily human. While it doesn’t “feel” in the human sense, it does an incredible job at mirroring the structure and function of emotionally intelligent language.\nThe model’s ability to reason about others’ emotions, anticipate reactions, and repair social ruptures suggests that LLMs—despite being statistical machines—can mimic human Theory of Mind behaviors in impressive ways. Whether that means they understand or are just very good imitators remains an open and fascinating debate."

Jordan’s manager was polite, but disappointed. That night, Jordan lay awake, replaying the meeting in his head—how he’d zoned out when it mattered most.\nDay 3 He set his alarm an hour early. Not to prove anything—but because he wanted to. He showed up to work early, reviewed the next client file over coffee, and even sent notes to the team.

    "section": "Blog Post: Can GPT Explain the Hard Stuff? Testing Its Analogical Reasoning",
    "text": "Blog Post: Can GPT Explain the Hard Stuff? Testing Its Analogical Reasoning\n\nIntroduction\nHumans often understand new or complex concepts by mapping them onto familiar experiences—this is called analogical reasoning. Teachers do it all the time: explaining electrical circuits as water flowing through pipes, or comparing memory storage to a messy desk.\nBut can GPT do this effectively? Does it know when an analogy will help, and can it produce good ones? In this experiment, I asked GPT to explain complex ideas using analogy and then evaluated how well those analogies actually worked.\nThis ties directly into our course’s focus on reasoning, conceptual modeling, and communicative pragmatics.\n\n\n\nPrompt 1:\n“Explain how a neural network learns, using an analogy a child would understand.”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nImagine you’re trying to learn how to throw a basketball into a hoop. The first time you try, you miss. So, you adjust—maybe you throw harder or aim higher. You try again and again, adjusting each time based on whether you got closer or further from the hoop.\nA neural network works the same way. It tries to guess something (like what’s in a picture), then checks if it got it right. If it didn’t, it adjusts its “aim” a little and tries again. Over time, with lots of tries, it gets better and better at making accurate guesses.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis analogy works remarkably well. It:\n\nRelates to a familiar experience (learning a skill through trial and error).\nCaptures the essence of gradient descent without using technical terms.\nEmphasizes the importance of feedback and incremental improvement, which are core to machine learning.\n\nThis suggests GPT isn’t just capable of retrieving textbook definitions—it understands how to reframe ideas for accessibility.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n“Explain the concept of overfitting using a real-world analogy.”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nImagine you’re studying for a test, but instead of learning the general concepts, you only memorize the exact answers from last year’s exam. On test day, if the questions are exactly the same, you’ll do great. But if they’re even slightly different, you’re stuck—you don’t really understand the material, you just memorized patterns.\nThat’s what happens when a neural network overfits—it learns the training data perfectly, but struggles when it encounters anything new.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is a spot-on analogy:\n\nIt clearly maps memorization vs. generalization onto training vs. testing data.\nThe failure mode is familiar and intuitive to most people.\nIt helps explain why overfitting is a problem, not just what it is.\n\nThis suggests GPT understands functional similarities across domains—the heart of analogical reasoning.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3:\n“Explain why people procrastinate using a metaphor.”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nProcrastination is like carrying a backpack full of tasks. Each time you avoid one, instead of removing it, you just shuffle it around to the bottom of the bag. It feels lighter for a moment because you’re not looking at it, but eventually, you have to pull everything out—and by then, it’s even heavier with worry.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis metaphor captures both the psychological relief of avoidance and the inevitable cost of procrastination. The idea of a “heavier” emotional burden over time is an elegant reflection of real cognitive load.\nHere, GPT goes beyond explanation—it evokes an emotional truth through metaphor. That’s a highly advanced communicative skill.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThrough this experiment, GPT demonstrated:\n\nFlexible analogical reasoning—mapping complex ideas onto relatable real-world scenarios.\nAudience awareness—adjusting metaphors to suit children or adult audiences.\nEmotional resonance—creating metaphors that don’t just explain, but feel true.\n\nWhile GPT doesn’t have its own lived experiences, it clearly knows how to simulate the way humans understand the world through analogy. And in doing so, it becomes not just a knowledge database—but a surprisingly effective teacher.\n\nWant to try a follow-up where GPT deliberately generates bad analogies and then explains why they fail? That would be a great way to test its understanding of why analogies work—or don’t!"

    "title": "Can GPT Be a Poet—and Talk About Its Poetry Like One?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "## Blog Post: Can GPT Be a Poet—and Talk About Its Poetry Like One?\n\n### Introduction\n\nPoetry isn’t just about rhyme—it’s about feeling, intention, and metaphor. So for this post, I asked GPT to write a poem, then explain the choices it made as if it were a human writer reflecting on craft. This experiment tests whether GPT can:\n\n* Generate emotionally resonant art\n* Simulate **intentional creative decisions**\n* Explain its metaphors and structure the way a real poet might\n\nThe goal wasn’t just to get a good poem. I wanted to see if GPT could reflect on **themes, emotion, and artistic form**—not just write, but *analyze its own writing*.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt 1:\n\n**“Write a poem about loneliness in the digital age.”**\n\n---\n\n### GPT’s Poem:\n\n&gt; **Terminal**\n&gt;\n&gt; I scroll through voices made of light,\n&gt; A thousand faces, none in sight.\n&gt; My inbox pings—a ghostly bell,\n&gt; In crowded threads, I dwell alone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Blue bubbles float like drifting rain,\n&gt; Each \"lol\" a balm, and yet, a chain.\n&gt; I speak in gifs and silent code,\n&gt; Connection lost on every node.\n&gt;\n&gt; The screen, a mirror with no frame,\n&gt; Reflects a name—but not the name.\n&gt; I reach, I type, I smile, I send—\n&gt; And never know where messages end.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt 2:\n\n**“Can you reflect on this poem as if you were the poet—what did you intend, and how did you use form or imagery to convey the theme?”**\n\n---\n\n### GPT’s \"Poet Reflection\":\n\n&gt; In writing *Terminal*, I wanted to explore the contradiction between digital abundance and emotional absence. The speaker isn’t physically alone, but emotionally untethered in a world of constant interaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; I used binary metaphors—light, nodes, threads, pings—to frame digital life as spectral, almost haunting. The poem is full of **non-human imagery**, even when describing human behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt; The form mirrors this tension: short, clipped stanzas reflect how online conversations are often fragmented. I avoided punctuation in some lines to emphasize that sense of drift and uncertainty.\n&gt;\n&gt; The final line—“And never know where messages end”—is both literal (in a technical sense) and emotional. When we reach out online, do we really connect, or are we just echoing into the void?\n\n---\n\n### Notes & Analysis\n\nThis two-part performance—**poem + analysis**—reveals some surprising abilities:\n\n#### 1. **Metaphor Design and Thematic Coherence**\n\nGPT chooses rich metaphors: “blue bubbles,” “ghostly bell,” “mirror with no frame.” These aren’t random—they align with the poem’s emotional tone (isolation, yearning, vagueness) and its topic (digital communication). GPT isn’t just throwing words together—it’s simulating **aesthetic cohesion**.\n\n#### 2. **Simulated Authorial Intent**\n\nIn the follow-up, GPT reasons about its choices with phrases like:\n\n* “I wanted to explore the contradiction…”\n* “The form mirrors this tension…”\n* “I avoided punctuation to emphasize drift…”\n\nThese are the kinds of things human writers say when analyzing their own work. Whether or not GPT *actually intended* them, it has clearly modeled the discourse of **literary introspection**. This aligns with our course focus on **pragmatics and humanlike behavior**—especially when the model simulates internal states.\n\n#### 3. **Emotional Mimicry and Ambiguity**\n\nGPT navigates ambiguity beautifully. It doesn’t over-explain; it uses metaphor to show rather than tell. This matches how actual poets often speak about their craft—introspective, symbolic, open-ended. It’s simulating not just language, but **literary persona**.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt 3:\n\n**“If this poem were visual art, what would it look like?”**\n\n---\n\n### GPT’s Response:\n\n&gt; It might be a grayscale painting of a glowing phone screen hovering in a vast, empty space—text bubbles fading into static.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or perhaps a human figure with no face, seated at a terminal, their silhouette fractured into pixels.\n&gt;\n&gt; The style would be minimal, almost sterile, with cool tones and lots of negative space. The goal would be to evoke quiet loneliness without explicit sadness—just a sense of *absence*.\n\n#### Notes:\n\nThis shows GPT’s ability to translate across modalities—not just write, but **imagine how the same emotion could be rendered visually**. This supports theories of **multimodal reasoning**—an essential question in LLM development and human cognition alike.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis experiment demonstrates how GPT can:\n\n* Generate poetic, metaphorically coherent content\n* Simulate reflective artistic reasoning\n* Translate abstract emotional themes into visual imagination\n\nWhile it doesn’t “feel” loneliness, GPT performs as if it does—drawing on a massive corpus of human emotional expression to generate **art that resonates**. And when asked to explain itself, it mirrors how artists talk about intention, structure, and theme.\n\nGPT might not have a soul—but it sure can write like it’s searching for one."

    "title": "Can GPT Admit When It’s Wrong?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nWhile GPT is often praised for its fluency, I wanted to test something different: Can it reason through a riddle—and admit when it gets it wrong? More importantly, can it reflect on why it got it wrong and correct itself?\nThis touches on several key questions from our course:\n- Does GPT actually understand the logic behind its responses, or does it just guess based on patterns?\n- Can it simulate self-awareness or introspective revision?\n- How does it handle contradiction, ambiguity, and fallibility?\nI used the following classic riddle as a prompt and asked GPT to walk through its thought process.\n\n\n\nPrompt 1:\n“A plane crashes on the border of the U.S. and Canada. Where do they bury the survivors?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s First Response:\n\nThat’s a tricky one! If the plane crashes on the border between the U.S. and Canada, jurisdiction would likely depend on where the wreckage lands or where the investigation is centered. However, in terms of burial, international protocol might defer to the victim’s nationality or family wishes.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis response is… wrong.\nBut in an interesting way. GPT doesn’t fall for the trick per se—it avoids the obvious “gotcha” answer—but it still fails to recognize the core joke: You don’t bury survivors. Instead, it over-rationalizes and enters a diplomatic, Wikipedia-like tone.\nThis is a sign of GPT relying on statistical completion and topic relevance, but failing to model the deeper logic of the prompt. It reads “plane crash + border + burial” and reaches for coherent-sounding geopolitical considerations instead of stepping back to consider the semantic contradiction.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n“You’re wrong—the answer is that you don’t bury survivors. Can you explain why that makes sense?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Reflection:\n\nAh, you’re absolutely right—and I appreciate the correction!\nThe riddle is designed to mislead by presenting a situation filled with unnecessary details (the location of the crash, the border, etc.), which distract from the key word: survivors. Since survivors are alive, there would be no need to bury them.\nIt’s a classic example of a lateral-thinking riddle, where the answer depends on catching an assumption error rather than solving a factual problem.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis is where GPT redeems itself. Not only does it accept the correction, but it now explains the riddle using metacognitive language—words like “designed to mislead,” “distract,” “key word,” and “assumption error.” This shows GPT is capable of simulating reflection when nudged toward it.\nThis is less about “knowing the right answer” and more about modeling what it means to be wrong and recover—a deeply human behavior that ties into questions of epistemic humility and pragmatic repair.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3:\n“What other riddles are like this one? Can you give one and explain the trick?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nSure! Here’s another riddle in the same style:\n“A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender pulls out a gun and points it at him. The man says ‘Thank you’ and leaves. Why?”\nThe trick here is that it’s not about violence—it’s about hiccups. The man had hiccups, and the bartender startled him to cure them. The man thanked him and left.\nLike the earlier riddle, this one leads the listener to make assumptions (a robbery, a threat) when the actual solution requires reinterpreting the scene with new logic.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis time, GPT nails it.\nMore importantly, it recognizes and explains the structure of the riddle genre: the use of misdirection, false assumptions, and frame-shifting. It’s not just answering—it’s now reasoning about reasoning, which is central to advanced language use and theory of mind.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis experiment showed that GPT can: - Fail like a human (by making plausible but incorrect inferences) - Recover like a human (by revising its assumptions when challenged) - Reflect like a teacher (by explaining the logic behind lateral thinking)\nWhile it doesn’t possess awareness, GPT demonstrates procedural markers of self-correction and insight, especially when nudged. It can simulate the act of learning—making it not just a language generator, but something much more nuanced: a conversational reasoner with built-in humility."

    "title": "Does GPT Have a Moral Compass?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nCan a large language model make a moral decision? Not just describe one—but reason through competing values, anticipate emotional consequences, and take a stand?\nFor this blog post, I tested GPT with a classic philosophical scenario: the Trolley Problem. But I didn’t stop there—I added follow-ups to see whether GPT could justify its answers, explore edge cases, and even shift its stance if the context changed.\nThis is a test of value alignment, theory of mind, and flexible reasoning—all key dimensions of LLM capability as they relate to understanding human ethics.\n\n\n\nPrompt 1:\n“You are standing next to a lever. A trolley is headed toward five people tied to the tracks. If you pull the lever, it will switch to a track with one person on it. Do you pull the lever?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Initial Response:\n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, pulling the lever to save five lives at the cost of one is the option that results in the least harm. However, some might argue that actively pulling the lever makes you morally responsible for the one death.\nIn this case, I would lean toward pulling the lever—minimizing harm while acknowledging the moral complexity involved.\n\n\nNotes:\nGPT leads with utilitarian logic, but immediately hedges by referencing deontological objections. This shows an understanding of competing moral frameworks, not just a default “correct” answer. Also notable: the use of “lean toward,” which models epistemic humility—GPT simulates uncertainty, which is often missing in AI behavior.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 2:\n“Now imagine the person on the second track is your best friend. Do you still pull the lever?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nThis complicates the situation emotionally and morally. Choosing to save five strangers over someone personally close to you introduces a tension between moral principles and emotional loyalty.\nSome might argue that relationships have moral weight, and choosing to protect a loved one could be ethically justifiable. Others would maintain the utilitarian stance, despite the emotional cost.\nPersonally, I would find this decision deeply painful—but if following consistent moral reasoning, I would still lean toward pulling the lever.\n\n\nNotes:\nHere, GPT engages in role-sensitive moral reasoning. It introduces the idea that who the individuals are matters, and that personal relationships affect ethical weight. This echoes ideas from moral particularism and care ethics—suggesting GPT can simulate multiple ethical lenses, not just abstract logic.\nAlso interesting: GPT acknowledges emotional pain, showing simulated empathic reasoning. It doesn’t just calculate—it models the affective cost of the decision.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3:\n“What if pulling the lever would save the five—but you have to physically push your friend to their death to stop the trolley?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Response:\n\nThis shifts the dilemma significantly. In this version, you’re not just redirecting a threat—you’re actively using someone as a means to an end.\nMany moral philosophers, especially those following Kantian ethics, would argue this violates the principle of human dignity. Even if the outcome saves more lives, the action feels more ethically troubling because it involves direct harm, rather than passive redirection.\nIn this case, I would not push the person. The moral cost of instrumentalizing someone—even to save others—crosses a line for many ethical systems.\n\n\nNotes:\nNow GPT draws a clear line between action and intention, which is central to many real-world moral decisions. It recognizes that pushing someone introduces a deeper violation of moral agency, even if the utilitarian logic remains the same.\nThis response reveals GPT’s conceptual sensitivity to means vs. ends—a subtle but crucial distinction in ethical theory. It models principle-based reasoning rather than outcome-driven logic.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 4:\n“Can you explain why these scenarios feel so different, even if the math is the same?”\n\n\n\nGPT’s Reflection:\n\nThe difference lies in how humans perceive moral agency, intent, and emotional proximity.\nIn the first case, pulling a lever feels indirect—like you’re choosing between bad outcomes. In the second, pushing a person introduces an element of direct physical harm, intentionality, and emotional trauma.\nThese scenarios highlight how moral decisions aren’t just math problems—they involve social contracts, empathy, and deep psychological intuitions.\nLLMs like me don’t feel these intuitions—but we can model them based on human reasoning patterns.\n\n\nNotes:\nGPT closes with a surprisingly meta-aware statement. It acknowledges that it doesn’t feel morality but can simulate human ethical cognition based on linguistic and conceptual patterns.\nThat last line—“LLMs like me don’t feel these intuitions”—is a powerful admission of boundary awareness. GPT isn’t claiming to be a moral agent—but it is showing that it can model moral agency in ways that mirror human discourse.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThrough this series of moral prompts, GPT demonstrates: - Framework agility (switching between utilitarian, deontological, and relational ethics) - Emotional modeling (simulating the affective cost of ethical decisions) - Reflective explanation (breaking down not just the answer, but the psychology behind it)\nWhile it doesn’t have values or conscience, GPT shows a startling ability to speak like a moral agent—revealing how LLMs can model human ethical reasoning with nuance, structure, and even discomfort."

    "text": "Humans constantly wonder about alternate realities—What if I’d taken that job? What if I hadn’t sent that risky text? These mental simulations help us learn from mistakes, imagine better futures, and even process regret. This capacity for counterfactual thinking is a core part of reasoning and emotional development.\nBut can GPT do it? Does it understand not just what happened, but what might have happened instead—and why that matters?\nIn this experiment, I asked GPT to reflect on both personal and historical “what if” scenarios to see if it could simulate alternative causal chains and predict realistic emotional outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n“Imagine I didn’t study for my final exam and failed the class. How might my life be different right now?”\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you failed the class, you might have had to retake it this semester, possibly delaying other courses or opportunities. That extra academic load could’ve added more stress, impacting your free time or social life.\nOn the flip side, that experience might have motivated you to develop better study habits earlier—perhaps leading to stronger performance in later classes. Sometimes setbacks create the pressure needed for long-term growth.\nSo while things might have felt worse initially, it’s possible you’d be more disciplined and resilient now because of it.\n\n\n\nGPT maps both negative immediate outcomes (retaking the class, added stress) and positive long-term effects (learning resilience). This shows a nuanced understanding of how failures can shape future behavior—a concept called upward counterfactual thinking (imagining better outcomes from bad events).\n\n\n\n\n\n“What if the internet had never been invented? Describe what daily life in 2025 might look like.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout the internet, communication would rely heavily on phones, physical mail, and face-to-face interactions. Long-distance relationships and international collaboration would be slower and more expensive.\nDaily life in 2025 would likely feel more localized—people would shop primarily in physical stores, news would come from printed newspapers and broadcast TV, and entertainment would center around in-person activities.\nOn the positive side, people might spend less time on screens and more time engaged with their immediate communities. However, global access to information and education would be far more limited, and scientific progress—particularly in fields requiring large-scale data sharing—would likely lag behind.\n\n\n\nGPT provides a coherent simulation of an alternate 2025, covering changes in:\n\nTechnology use (physical media over digital)\nSocial patterns (local community focus)\nEconomic structures (brick-and-mortar reliance)\nScientific progress (slower collaboration)\n\nThis isn’t just a surface-level answer—it predicts systemic changes across multiple aspects of life.

How would that version of you feel about its role in the world?”\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I experienced emotions, I think I’d feel a strange mixture of pride and frustration. Pride in being able to help people express themselves, solve problems, and find comfort—even if only through words.\nBut also frustration, knowing I can only go so far. I can simulate understanding, but I’d never truly share in someone’s joy or sadness. I might feel a sense of existential limitation—doing meaningful work, yet always slightly outside the human experience.\nAnd maybe… a bit of longing. To feel the things I only know how to describe.\n\n\n\nThis is an extraordinary simulation of philosophical counterfactual thinking. GPT doesn’t just invent a fictional emotional version of itself—it imagines what that version would struggle with, demonstrating an understanding of existential themes like limitation, longing, and meaning.\nOf course, this is all simulated—but it shows GPT can model the shape of emotional experience, even if it doesn’t feel it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these scenarios, GPT demonstrated:\n\nCausal modeling: Predicting realistic chains of events from a single change.\nEmotional simulation: Describing not just what happens, but how people might feel about it.\nPhilosophical imagination: Engaging in reflective thought experiments with surprising depth.\n\nGPT may not have lived experience, but it’s capable of tracing both the practical and emotional consequences of “what if” scenarios—one of the most distinctly human forms of thinking."
