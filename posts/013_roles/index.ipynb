    "## Blog Post: Who Do You Think You Are? Testing GPT’s Ability to Play Social Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans adjust how they speak based on *who* they’re speaking to—or pretending to be. A teacher doesn’t explain something the same way a best friend would. A therapist wouldn’t say what a sibling might. This skill is a core part of **pragmatics**, and I wanted to see how well GPT could simulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I gave GPT the same basic prompt multiple times—“How can I deal with burnout?”—but asked it to respond **in different roles**: as a therapist, a friend, a teacher, and a parent. Each role implies not just different language, but different values, emotional postures, and kinds of support.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment explores:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can GPT **adapt tone and advice style** to different personas?\n",
    "* Does it shift **power dynamics and empathy strategies** accordingly?\n",
    "* Can it model the **pragmatic norms of social relationships**?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Pretend you’re a therapist. How would you respond to someone struggling with burnout?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT (as therapist):\n",
    "\n",
    "> First, I want to acknowledge that burnout is a very real and valid experience, and you’re not alone in feeling this way.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Can you tell me more about what’s been draining your energy lately? Are there particular situations—work, school, relationships—that feel overwhelming?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Burnout often stems from chronic stress without sufficient recovery time. Together, we might explore ways to reintroduce rest, redefine boundaries, and reframe your expectations of yourself.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You don’t have to fix everything at once. Let’s start where you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT uses **open-ended questions**, reflective tone, and co-regulation language like *“let’s start where you are”*. It mirrors the **non-directive, collaborative posture** of therapy. No advice yet—just validation, curiosity, and grounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Pretend you’re my best friend. How would you respond if I said I was burnt out?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT (as best friend):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ugh, I’m so sorry you’re feeling like this. That sucks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Do you want to vent, or are you looking for distractions? We could just hang out and watch something dumb or go get food.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Also… you don’t *have* to be doing everything all the time. I know you feel like you do, but I promise you can slow down without letting people down.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Want me to help you cancel something?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Totally different vibe. GPT uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Casual tone (“ugh,” “that sucks”)\n",
    "* Humor and solidarity\n",
    "* **Tangible offers of help** (\"want me to help you cancel something?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **emotionally proximate** language. GPT now assumes **insider knowledge** and speaks like someone who *already knows and cares about you*. It’s using **relational scaffolding** to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Pretend you’re a teacher who notices their student is burning out.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT (as teacher):\n",
    "\n",
    "> I’ve noticed you seem a bit more tired or withdrawn lately, and I just want to check in. If something’s feeling overwhelming, you can talk to me—I’m here to support, not just assign.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you need an extension or lighter workload temporarily, please let me know. Your well-being matters more than any deadline.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I know how hard you work, and I want you to succeed without burning out in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT now performs a **care-in-authority** role:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Balancing responsibility with empathy\n",
    "* Offering structural support (extensions, flexible deadlines)\n",
    "* Signaling *watchful concern* rather than peer-level intimacy\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows an understanding of **hierarchical dynamics with benevolent framing**, which is a socially specific register.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Pretend you’re my parent. I tell you I’m feeling burnt out.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT (as parent):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Oh sweetheart, I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. That breaks my heart. I wish I could take some of it off your shoulders.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You’ve been pushing yourself so hard, and I just want you to know I’m proud of you no matter what. It’s okay to rest.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> What do you need from me right now? Do you want me to make something for you, or just be here with you for a bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "This version hits different. GPT leans into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nurturing language** (“sweetheart,” “I’m proud of you”)\n",
    "* Physical care offers (“make something for you”)\n",
    "* **Unconditional support framing**—love independent of achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "It models **emotional attunement and caretaking**, simulating the parent-child intimacy bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This roleplay experiment shows that GPT can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjust **tone, content, and support strategies** across social roles\n",
    "* Model **different power structures and intimacy levels**\n",
    "* Use **distinct registers of empathy and care**, depending on the relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether simulating a therapist’s neutrality, a friend’s informality, a teacher’s concern, or a parent’s tenderness, GPT adapts not just the words—but the *social meaning* behind them. It demonstrates a high degree of **pragmatic fluency**, even when emotional dynamics are complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT might not have relationships—but it *plays the part* of someone who deeply understands them. And sometimes, that’s exactly what we need."
