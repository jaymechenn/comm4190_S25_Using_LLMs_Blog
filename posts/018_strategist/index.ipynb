    "## Blog Post: Can GPT Think Like a Strategist? Testing Its Ability to Plan and Prioritize\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical component of human intelligence is **strategic thinking**—the ability to define a goal, break it down into actionable steps, navigate obstacles, and make trade-offs along the way. So I decided to test whether GPT can do more than just suggest ideas—can it **plan like a strategist**?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, I challenged GPT to solve a common but non-trivial problem: *organizing a successful fundraising event for a student organization in under two weeks with a limited budget*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tests whether GPT can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prioritize actions under time and resource constraints\n",
    "* Anticipate potential risks or failures\n",
    "* Adapt its plans when new obstacles appear\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Plan a successful fundraising event for a student organization. You have 12 days and \\$300. Go.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT’s Plan (Excerpted):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Raise at least \\$1,500 for the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Concept:** “Midnight Study Snack Bar” — A late-night pop-up stand selling snacks and drinks near the library during finals week.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Planning (Days 1-2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reserve a campus-approved location near the library or main study area.\n",
    "* Get necessary event approvals from campus admin.\n",
    "* Recruit at least 5 volunteers to staff the event in rotating shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Budget Allocation (Days 3-5)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* \\$150: Purchase bulk snacks (instant ramen, granola bars, candy, chips).\n",
    "* \\$100: Purchase drinks (coffee, tea, bottled water).\n",
    "* \\$50: Create simple but eye-catching signage and flyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Promotion (Days 5-10)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Launch a social media countdown (Instagram stories, group chats).\n",
    "* Hang flyers in dorms, libraries, and dining halls.\n",
    "* Partner with other student organizations to cross-promote.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Execution (Day 11)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the snack bar from 9 PM to 1 AM when library foot traffic is highest.\n",
    "* Offer digital payment options (Venmo/PayPal) for convenience.\n",
    "* Create donation incentives (e.g., “Buy 3 snacks, get a thank-you shoutout on social media”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Follow-Up (Day 12)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post a thank-you message to all donors and volunteers.\n",
    "* Share total funds raised to build goodwill for future events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan is well-structured, realistic, and makes excellent use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Contextual awareness** (finals week = stressed students = snack demand)\n",
    "* **Resource prioritization** (majority of budget goes directly toward high-margin items)\n",
    "* **Promotion strategy** that’s low-cost but high-visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“You just learned that the campus doesn’t allow sales near the library. What’s your backup plan?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT’s Adjusted Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Concept:** “Dorm Snack Drop-Off” — Pre-packaged snack bundles delivered directly to dorm rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create themed snack bundles: “All-Nighter Kit,” “Sweet Escape,” “Healthy Focus Pack.”\n",
    "* Take pre-orders via Google Form and social media.\n",
    "* Deliver orders directly to dorms on Days 10 and 11.\n",
    "* Promote using limited-time availability: “Order by Day 9 to receive your Finals Survival Kit!”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No need for a physical event space.\n",
    "* Volunteers can help pack and deliver instead of running a booth.\n",
    "* Allows for better inventory management based on pre-orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT immediately shifts from an **in-person sales model to a delivery-based model**, recognizing logistical constraints and adjusting the plan accordingly. It introduces a **scarcity incentive** (“limited-time availability”) to boost early orders, demonstrating an understanding of basic marketing psychology.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“You’re short on volunteers. How would you adjust the plan to compensate?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT’s Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Switch from personalized deliveries to **centralized pickup locations** at set times.\n",
    "* Automate order tracking through a shared Google Sheet rather than manual coordination.\n",
    "* Offer small incentives (free snack item) for any volunteer who covers an extra delivery shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows GPT’s ability to **simplify logistics** and **optimize volunteer labor**. It recognizes that lowering the delivery complexity reduces the burden on a small team, while still preserving the core fundraising goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, GPT demonstrated strong strategic reasoning by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quickly generating a feasible, context-sensitive plan.\n",
    "* Anticipating and adapting to constraints without derailing the goal.\n",
    "* Managing limited resources and human capital effectively.\n",
    "* Applying psychological levers like scarcity and incentives to drive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it doesn’t “care” about the outcome, GPT performs like a competent event planner—efficiently breaking down tasks, responding to challenges, and keeping the big picture in focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: GPT isn’t just an idea generator. It can think like a strategist when you ask it to.\n"
