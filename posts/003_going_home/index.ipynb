    "I'm feeling a bit homesick today, so I asked GPT to create a 3-day travel itenerary for my hometown. I know the area well, so I know the great beaches and restaurants to go to. I have a personal itenerary for when I get home, so I'm interested to see if GPT's plans will align with mine."

    "> Response: That sounds like a fun trip! Are you looking for recommendations on vegan food, activities, or anything specific while you're there?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "* Interestingly, rather than immediately offering me a travel plan, GPT agreed that my trip sounded fun and inquired if I wanted any specific information\n",
    "* This is more similar to a response I would expect from a human. Upon hearing about my trip, I would not expect a friend to launch into a travel itenerary, so GPT modeled a normal conversation quite well\n",
    "* However, it anticipates that I will ask it to retreive some information, likely because there is not much reason for me to arbitrarily inform an AI model of my travel plans\n",
